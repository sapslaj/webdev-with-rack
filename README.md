# WebDev with Rack! (And Guard)

This is a quick boilerplate thingy I made to quickly start bootstrapping development of web applications. Just `git clone` the repo, `bundle install`, then run `guard` and start working!

## Things and features and stuff
- Asset compilation with Sprockets
- Browser LiveReload
- No Application server needed! Deploy directly to any server after doing a `rake assets:build`
- Twitter Bootstrap included by default (but easily removed)

## What this isn't
This isn't a replacement for Yeoman or any of those other tools. This is just a simpler version written in Ruby. I do not guarantee that the methods used are best practice.

## TODO
A lot

## Bugs
A lot
