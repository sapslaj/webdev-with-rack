# WebDev with Rack! (And Guard)

This is a quick boilerplate thingy I made to quickly start bootstrapping development of web applications. Just `git clone` the repo, `bundle install`, then run `guard` and start working!

## Things and features and stuff
- Asset compilation with Sprockets
- Browser LiveReload
- No Application server needed! Deploy directly to any server after doing a `rake assets:build`
- Twitter Bootstrap included by default (but easily removed)
